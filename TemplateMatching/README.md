Notebooks for template matching of SPED data from Al-Cu-Li alloy containing cubic Al, tetragonal theta prime and hexagonal T1 phases.

The following is included in this repository:

0) Notebook for creating a ground truth image of the SPED scan from using virtual dark field images.
1) Notebook for creating an Al mask and removing background noise using a difference of gaussian method.
2) A suggestion for optimizing the max excitation error (s) used for simulating diffractin patterns.
3) Template matching of three phases (Al, theta prime, T1) using hyperspy and pyXem libraries.

For more information on the template matching workflow see: https://github.com/pyxem/pyxem-demos and https://github.com/din14970/pyxem_template_matching_workflows.
